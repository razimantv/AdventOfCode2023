# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

I solved all problems of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [this time](https://adventofcode.com/2023). This was also the first time I went through an entire major contest in Python since my recent switch from C++ to Python on LeetCode (had to use sagemath for one problem, but I think it still counts).

I have shared my python code to solve all the problems, along with the explanations for all the solutions (starred some solutions I found unusual/interesting/fun)

* [Problem 1](1)
* [Problem 2](2)
* [Problem 3](3)
* [Problem 4](4)
* [Problem 5](5)
* [Problem 6](6)
* [Problem 7](7)
* [Problem 8](8)
* [Problem 9](9)
* [Problem 10](10) (⭐)
* [Problem 11](11)
* [Problem 12](12)
* [Problem 13](13)

Please raise an issue if you want further clarifications for some solution or need explanations for something I have done in some code.
